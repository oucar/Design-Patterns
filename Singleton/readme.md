### Singleton Pattern
- The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point access to it.
- We're taking a class and letting it manage a single instance of itself.
- We are also preventing any other class from creating a new instance on its own. To get an instance, you've got to go through the class itself.
- We're also providing a global access point to the instance.
