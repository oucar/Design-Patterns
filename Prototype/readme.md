# Prototype Pattern - Creational Design Pattern

## Overview
It involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, rather than creating new instances from scratch.

## When to Use
Use the Prototype Pattern when:
- Creating new instances of an object is more complex or resource-intensive than copying an existing instance.
- You want to isolate the process of creating new objects from the client code that uses them.
- You need to create new objects with different initial states but with the same structure.
- Unlike factory pattern, the prototype pattern allows you to create new instances by copying existing ones, which can be more efficient in certain scenarios.

## Why it's Useful
1. **Reduced Overhead**: Instead of creating new instances by invoking constructors and initializing each property, the Prototype Pattern allows you to create new instances by cloning existing ones, reducing overhead.
  
2. **Flexibility**: The pattern provides flexibility by allowing clients to specify the concrete prototypes to clone and customize the properties of the cloned objects based on their requirements.
  
3. **Performance**: It can improve performance, especially in scenarios where object creation is expensive, by avoiding repetitive construction logic and initialization.
  
4. **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the object creation process within the prototype and shields client code from the complexity of creating new instances, promoting separation of concerns.

## Example Use Cases
- **Rendering Systems**: In graphical applications, such as games, where objects need to be rendered with various configurations, the Prototype Pattern can be used to create copies of existing graphical objects with different attributes (e.g., color, size) for rendering.
  
- **Document Editing Tools**: In document editing software, where users can create multiple instances of similar documents, the Prototype Pattern can be employed to clone existing document templates and customize them according to user input.

- **Database Entity Initialization**: When initializing database entities with predefined attributes, the Prototype Pattern can be utilized to create copies of existing entity instances and modify specific properties based on user input before persisting them to the database.


## Downsides
- **Deep Copy Complexity**: Implementing deep copy functionality for complex objects can be challenging, especially when dealing with nested objects or circular references.

## Pros
-  You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.
-  You can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.
-  You can produce complex objects more conveniently.
- You get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.
