### Strategy Pattern 
##### Separate the  parts that change from those that stay the same!
---
- **Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
- Behaviors are encapsulated really well.
- Strategy pattern lets you change behavior at runtime.
- Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
- Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional statement that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.
